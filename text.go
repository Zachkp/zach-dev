	AboutMe = `I love building software that’s both useful and fun, and I’m always curious about how things work behind the scenes. 
	Most of my projects start with a simple idea and turn into a chance to learn something new, whether it’s exploring a 
	different language, experimenting with tools, or solving tricky problems.
	When I’m not coding, you’ll usually find me training Muay Thai, shooting pool with friends, 
	or chasing down a new challenge outside the screen.`

	using the Charmbracelet TUI framework and go-imap.`

	similarity to recommend games based on content analysis, featuring interactive data visualizations and
