	AboutMe = `I love building software that's both useful and fun, and I'm always curious about how 
	things work behind the scenes. Most of my projects start with a simple idea and turn 
	into a chance to learn something new—whether exploring a different language, 
	experimenting with tools, or solving tricky problems. I'm looking for opportunities 
	where that curiosity and hands-on approach can make a real impact.
	
	When I'm not coding, you'll find me training Muay Thai, shooting pool with friends, 
	or chasing down a new challenge outside the screen.`
